The secure version uses app.use(session to make sure that the userId is the same with the
request user, it prevents privilege escalation.
I think it can be proved with 2 factor authentication, such that if a unauthorized user
still gets a high privilege user's access somehow, he still needs password or other methods for
his other operations.
